BCWattBalance 4900 Project Code Repository

This software is to be submitted for the partial fulfillment of
	CISC 4900 Project at CUNY Brooklyn College.

	The software will be used to control various hardware peripherals of the
	Tiva C-Series Launchpad via software calls to the TM4C microcontroller.
	The peripherals will control and measure different components of a
	Watt Balance apparatus. The hardware will control the operation of lasers,
	electromagnetic coils, and measurement of electrical signals via their
	respective electronic circuits.
	
	Code written, built, and debugged with TI Code Composer Studio 6.1.2
	Compiled with TI ARM Compiler 5.2.7
	Tested with TI TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller on Tiva C-Series LaunchPad
